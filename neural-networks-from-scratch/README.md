# CNN Fundamentals

This repository provides hands-on implementations of essential **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** concepts.  
The goal is to help you build a deep understanding of how convolution-based models function internally.

It focuses on both **manual (NumPy-based)** implementations and **framework-based (PyTorch)** approaches,  
bridging the gap between theory and practical deep learning.


## Topics Covered

- 2D convolution implemented manually with NumPy  
- Padding and stride logic explained and applied  
- Max pooling and average pooling built from scratch  
- A simple CNN built using PyTorch  


## Purpose

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the foundation of most modern computer vision systems.  
By implementing key components manually and then through a deep learning framework, this project helps clarify how CNNs extract spatial features and learn hierarchical patterns from data.
